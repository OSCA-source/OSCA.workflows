Description: 
    Deploys the workflows of the "Orchestrating Single Cell Analysis with Bioconductor" book.
    This contains worked case studies of analyses of a variety of single-cell datasets, each proceeding from a SingleCellExperiment object.
    Exposition is generally minimal other than for dataset-specific justifications for parameter tweaks;
    refer to the other books in the OCSA collection for a detailed explanation of the theoretical basis of each step.
    It is intended for readers who already know the background and just want some code to copy and paste into their own analyses.
